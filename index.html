<h1>boats</h1>

There are many kinds of boats.<br>
One kind of boat is called a sailboat. A sailboat uses the wind to move. Wind makes a
sailboat move in the water. The wind pushes the sailboat. Wind fills the sails. The sailboat moves
when the wind blows.<br>
One kind of boat is called a motorboat. A motorboat uses a motor to move. The motor
gives power to the boat. The motorboat moves when the motor is running. The motorboat makes
a loud noise.<br>
One kind of boat is called a rowboat. A rowboat needs people to move it. People make a
rowboat move in the water. People use oars to move a rowboat. Oars are long and flat. Oars go
into the water. A rowboat moves when people use the oars.<br>
